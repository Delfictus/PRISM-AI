# Session Summary: DIMACS Integration & Aggressive Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
**Branch:** `aggressive-optimization` (11 commits)  
**Mission:** Integrate DIMACS + optimize toward world record (<48 colors)  
**Result:** Integration ✅, Ceiling identified at ~72-75 colors

---

## ✅ Completed: DIMACS Integration

All 4 benchmarks producing valid, conflict-free colorings:
- DSJC500-5: 72 colors (best: 47-48) 
- DSJC1000-5: 126 colors (best: 82-83)
- C2000-5: 223 colors (best: 145)
- C4000-5: 401 colors (best: 259)

Quality: ~53% above optimal (consistent across scales)

## 🔬 Experiments: Optimization Attempts

### Tested:
1. Aggressive expansion (30 iter) → 75 colors ❌
2. Multi-start (500 attempts) → 75 colors ❌  
3. 100D pipeline (vs 20D) → 75 colors ❌
4. Simulated annealing (50K iter) → 75 colors ❌
5. GPU parallel (WIP, 90% done) → TBD

### Finding: Quality Ceiling at ~72-75 Colors

Phase-guided greedy cannot escape this range with current techniques.

## 💡 Key Insight

**GPU parallel search could still help:**
- Current: 500 CPU attempts in 278ms  
- Potential: 10K-100K GPU attempts in seconds
- Hypothesis: Massive scale might find outliers

**Status:** CUDA kernel ready, Rust wrapper needs cudarc API fix

## 📋 Recommendations

**Path A:** Document current work (72 colors, novel approach)
**Path B:** Finish GPU implementation (1-2h), test with 100K attempts  
**Path C:** Implement hybrid DSATUR+phase (2 weeks)

**My recommendation:** Path B first (quick test), then Path A (document)
