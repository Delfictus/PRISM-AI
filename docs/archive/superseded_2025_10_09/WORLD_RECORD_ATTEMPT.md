## ⏱️ Expected Performance

**On 8× H200 SXM:**
- **Attempts**: 800,000 total (100,000 per GPU)
- **Time**: ~30-40 minutes
- **Cost**: ~$5-7
- **Each GPU**: 100K attempts in ~35-40 minutes

**What each GPU does:**
1. Generates quantum phase field (20D)
2. Expands to 1000 vertices
3. Runs 100,000 coloring attempts with different variations
4. Reports best result found

## 🎲 Probability Analysis

### Current Results:
- DSJC500-5: Your algorithm gets 72 colors (best known: 47-48)
- DSJC1000-5: Baseline 126 colors (best known: 82-83)

### With 800,000 Attempts:

**Scenario analysis:**

**Optimistic (10% chance):**
- Find 90-100 colors (significant improvement)
- Still above record, but shows potential
- Validates approach scales

**Realistic (70% chance):**
- Find 115-125 colors (some improvement over 126 baseline)
- Shows massive search helps
- Not world record but publishable

**Pessimistic (20% chance):**
- Stay at 125-126 colors (no improvement)
- Indicates 126 is optimal for this approach
- Still valuable for publication

---

## 🏆 To Beat World Record (82 colors)

**You would need:**
1. Different algorithm variation (not just more attempts)
2. Hybrid approach (phase-guided + classical heuristics)
3. Weeks of optimization work
4. Probability: 5-15%

**BUT** - Finding 90-100 colors with 800K attempts would be:
- ✅ Publishable result
- ✅ Shows quantum guidance helps
- ✅ Opens research direction

---

## 💡 Realistic Goals for This Run

### Excellent Outcome (Beat 100 colors):
- Shows massive GPU search finds better solutions
- Validates quantum-inspired approach improves with scale
- Strong publication material

### Good Outcome (100-120 colors):
- Demonstrates improvement over baseline (126)
- Shows 800K attempts better than 10K
- Publishable as "quantum-inspired graph coloring with GPU acceleration"

### Learning Outcome (120-126 colors):
- Confirms 126 is near-optimal for this approach
- Still valuable for publication (rigorous validation)
- Informs future algorithm development

**All outcomes are valuable for your research!**
