# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 001
## Periodic Build Verification Mandate

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** ✅ ENACTED
**Scope:** Web Platform Development

---

## AMENDMENT SUMMARY

This amendment adds **Article V: Periodic Build Verification** to the Web Platform Implementation Constitution, establishing mandatory compilation and testing checkpoints to prevent error accumulation during development.

---

## RATIONALE

**Problem Identified:**
During rapid development, it's possible to accumulate compilation errors, type errors, and test failures across multiple tasks, leading to:
- Cascading errors that are difficult to debug
- Wasted time fixing multiple interdependent issues
- Technical debt from building on broken foundations
- Loss of development velocity

**Solution:**
Mandate periodic build verification after every 2-3 tasks (max 90 minutes), ensuring:
- All code compiles before proceeding
- Type safety is maintained continuously
- Tests pass at every checkpoint
- Errors are caught immediately, not accumulated

---

## ARTICLE V: PERIODIC BUILD VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

### Core Principle
> **Never build on top of errors. All code must compile and pass tests before proceeding to the next task.**

### Key Requirements

**5.1 Continuous Compilation Requirement**
- MANDATORY verification after every significant code change
- Maximum 90 minutes OR 3 tasks between verifications
- Both frontend (TypeScript/React) and backend (Rust) must compile

**5.2 Verification Frequency**
Required checkpoints:
1. After completing each major task
2. Before starting Week 2/3/4 (milestone verification)
3. After installing new dependencies
4. Before committing to git (pre-commit hook)
5. At end of each development session

**5.3 Build Verification Checklist**
Frontend:
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
- `npm run lint` - ESLint checks (0 errors/warnings)
- `npm run build` - Production build must succeed
- `npm run test` - Unit tests must pass

Backend (if cargo available):
- `cargo check` - Fast compilation check
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` - Linter checks
- `cargo test --lib` - Library tests

**5.4 Error Accumulation Prevention**
- FORBIDDEN: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Try to build → **BLOCKED**
- REQUIRED: Task 1 → ✅ Verify → Task 2 → ✅ Verify → Task 3 → ✅ Verify

**5.5 Automated Build Gates**
- Pre-commit hook runs verification automatically
- CI/CD pipeline enforces on every push
- Status dashboard shows build health

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES

### 1. Constitution Document Updated
**File:** `WEB-PLATFORM-CONSTITUTION.md`
- Added Article V (300+ lines)
- Renumbered subsequent articles (VI → XIII)
- Added comprehensive enforcement mechanisms

### 2. Governance Engine Updated
**File:** `GOVERNANCE-ENGINE.md`
- Added "CRITICAL: PERIODIC BUILD VERIFICATION" section
- Included mandatory checkpoint schedule
- Provided verification scripts and CI integration

### 3. Package.json Enhanced
**File:** `prism-web-platform/package.json`
- Added `type-check` script: TypeScript compilation without emit
- Added `verify:quick` script: Fast type-check + lint
- Added `verify:all` script: Full verification (type + lint + build)

---

## USAGE GUIDELINES

### For Developers

**After Every 2-3 Tasks:**
```bash
cd prism-web-platform
npm run verify:quick     # Fast check (2-3 minutes)
# OR
npm run verify:all       # Full check (5-10 minutes)
```

**Before Git Commit:**
```bash
# Pre-commit hook will automatically run:
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# → Runs type-check, lint, build automatically
```

**End of Session:**
```bash
# Full verification before closing
npm run verify:all

# Backend check (if cargo available)
cd ..
cargo check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test --lib
```

### For CI/CD

**GitHub Actions (Already Configured):**
- Runs on every push to main/develop
- Verifies both frontend and backend
- Blocks merge if verification fails

---

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Build-Time
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (blocks on type errors)
- ✅ ESLint (blocks on errors/warnings)
- ✅ Bundle size limits (fails if exceeded)

### Runtime
- ✅ Performance monitoring (alerts on violations)
- ✅ Frame budget enforcement (60fps)
- ✅ WebSocket latency tracking (<100ms)

### Workflow
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks (automatic verification)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (continuous verification)
- ✅ Status dashboard (build health monitoring)

---

## COMPLIANCE TRACKING

### Article V Compliance Criteria

**FULL COMPLIANCE requires:**
- [ ] Verification run after every 2-3 tasks ✅
- [ ] No task started with failing build ✅
- [ ] Pre-commit hook installed ✅
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing ✅
- [ ] Build health monitored in dashboard ⏳

**Current Status:** 4/5 criteria met (80% compliant)
**Target:** 100% compliance by end of Week 2

---

## BENEFITS

### Immediate
- ✅ Catch errors early (easier to fix)
- ✅ Maintain clean codebase (no technical debt accumulation)
- ✅ Increase development velocity (less debugging time)
- ✅ Improve code quality (enforced standards)

### Long-Term
- ✅ Reduce integration issues
- ✅ Enable confident refactoring
- ✅ Maintain production-grade quality
- ✅ Support rapid iteration
